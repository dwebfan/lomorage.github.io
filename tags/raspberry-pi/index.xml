      <description>How ddns works You register a subdomain at ddns service provider, for example &amp;ldquo;lomorage.duckdns.org&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;lomorage&amp;rdquo; is the sub domain, then the ddns service provider will allocate a token for you, and you start at ddns client with that token to validate your are the subdomain owner, and ddns service provide will know your public IP address. Then when someone access the subdomain, ddns service provider will tell them the your public IP address and access your service directly.</description>
